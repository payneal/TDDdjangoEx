#### This is my attempt to learn TDD with django

Harry Percival - TDD with Django

started with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQjmz9wCjLA

ended with: http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754/index.html

I would advise anyone interested in learning TDD to do the same its very informative. One could even call it a website kata walk through
